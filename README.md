- Establishing the predictive efficacy of cells pre-treated with well-established staining methods using convolutional neural networks. A cytologist’s typical samples are clusters of cells extracted from tissue using various instruments such as brushes, spatulas, or swabs. Later, cells are colored using Papanicolaou’s approach, which has the advantage of keeping adequate transparency of the cytoplasm while revealing exceptional detail of the nucleus structure. Finally, the cytologist examines the cells under the microscope, classifies them, and evaluates any abnormalities. Eliminating the human component from the diagnosis could increase the effectiveness of the test as well as reduce costs and time.
- Whether there is at least one cell positive for structural abnormalities such as cancer, in a slide containing hundreds of cells, thanks to image segmentation with the convolutional neural networks. This approach could increase the sensitivity since we believe that this is not ideal due to the problem of undersampling the sample. Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into semantically relevant and aesthetically coherent areas, allowing for the investigation and comprehension of particular objects or regions within an image. Using this approach, the machine can learn the characteristics of an abnormal cell and detect it alongside thousands of other cells. In contrast, slides traditionally contain only a dozen cells.
- Whether a lesser-used staining method could constitute the new state of the art in cytology, with CNN, K-means, t-SNE and a genetic algorithm, i.e., the AgNOR technique. AgNOR staining is a commonly used technique in cytopathology for cancer cell detection but cervical ones, with Papanicolaou’s being the most common. Indeed, several studies concluded that the mean number of AgNORs of tumor cells is a significant prognostic factor in surgically treated lung cancer patients.
